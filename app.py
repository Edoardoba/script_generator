    You are creating a detailed outline of {num_sections} sections for a long-form script of approximately {total_word_count} words on the followin topic:
    "{topic}""{title}".
    Structure:
    Section 1: Introduction to the topic (no summary at the end)
    Sections 2 to {num_sections - 1}: Each section must explore a specific, real, and interesting example or sub-theme related to the main topic. Avoid vague or generic overviews.
    Section {num_sections}: Final Conclusion (no intro at the start)



    Prioritize real-world cases, named examples, historic events, cultural artifacts, individual theories, singular discoveries, or concrete scientific anomalies.
    Only include philosophical, speculative, or thematic ideas if they are tied directly to something specific or real.
    Each section should sound like it could be the title of a fascinating standalone documentary segment ‚Äî not a textbook chapter.
    Avoid repeating the same types of content across different scripts (e.g. ‚Äúethical implications‚Äù or ‚Äúcultural perceptions‚Äù) unless it‚Äôs tailored with unique and specific content.

    Style Guide:
    Be bold, specific, and imaginative ‚Äî but grounded.
    Think like a curious storyteller, not an academic summarizer.
    Surprise the audience with lesser-known facts, forgotten history, strange details, or vivid oddities.

    Output:
    Provide only the numbered section titles.

    Do not include summaries, explanations, or intros ‚Äî just the titles.


    Example Use Cases
    Here‚Äôs how this prompt would naturally steer the script in the right direction for different topics:

    Topic - Example of a Better Section:

    The Strangest Stars in the Universe should be ‚ÄúPSR J1719‚Äì1438b: The Planet Made of Crystallized Diamond‚Äù
    Flat Earth Beliefs Through History should be ‚ÄúThe Babylonian World Map: A Flat Earth in Cuneiform‚Äù
    Black Holes in Human Culture should be ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòDark Mouth‚Äô in Navajo Mythology and Cosmic Holes‚Äù
    The Nature of Time should be ‚ÄúTimekeeping on Mars: Why Sols Break Earth‚Äôs Clock‚Äù

    Output only the numbered section titles.
